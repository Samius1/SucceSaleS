# User Journey
In this section, we will describe the user journeys for our application. As you already know, this application is focused on sales, so user journeys are focus on that too.

* User journey 1.- A manager reviews the stock in the shop in the afternoon. After  that, he opens the application and generates a report with the expected sales for the next day. Then, he writes down a list of product to buy. 

* User journey 2.- After a long day's work, a manager closes the shop. When he arrives home, he starts to count the money earned that day. Then, he opens the application and generates a report of the sales, selecting the actual day. He just uses this report to check if the amount of product matches the money.

* User journey 3.- A manager needs to declare the sales of the year. He keeps a handmade registry, but he doesn't know how much product he has sold. The manager opens the application and generates a report with the sales done, selecting the 1st of January and the 31st of December of 2021.
